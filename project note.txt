AI Powered Fake News Detection Application
System Overview – Standard One-Click Deployment
Introduction

The AI Powered Fake News Detection Application is an evidence-based misinformation verification system designed to analyze textual claims, retrieve real-world supporting evidence from the web, apply semantic reasoning, and return a final verdict with a clear explanation.

The system combines transformer-based machine learning models, web evidence retrieval, and deterministic reasoning logic to ensure reliable and explainable fact-checking. A web-based interface allows end users to submit claims and receive verdicts instantly. The entire system is containerized and can be launched with a single click for local or public access.

The project is showcased under the expo name TEJAS, but the core application remains a standalone AI-powered fact-checking platform.

Purpose

The system is built to:

Detect and verify potentially false or misleading information.

Retrieve evidence from multiple trusted web sources.

Apply semantic similarity and contradiction detection.

Produce a deterministic verdict with justification.

Provide a simple web interface for public users.

Operate as a continuously running service when deployed on a server.

System Capabilities
1. Text-Based Claim Verification

Accepts user-submitted text claims.

Uses a transformer-based classifier for model confidence signaling.

Performs semantic search for related evidence from the web.

Ranks evidence by relevance and source authority.

Detects contradictions using Natural Language Inference (NLI).

Produces final verdicts:

TRUE

FALSE

INSUFFICIENT

2. Evidence-Based Reasoning Engine

Multi-source web evidence retrieval.

Cross-domain corroboration logic.

Operator-driven reasoning to handle different claim types.

Priority-based contradiction detection.

Source authority scoring for trust weighting.

3. AI-Generated Explanations

Verdict generation remains deterministic.

An AI explanation agent produces human-readable justifications.

The AI layer cannot alter the verdict.

Ensures transparency and explainability.

4. REST API Service

FastAPI backend with structured endpoints.

JSON-based request and response schema.

Swagger documentation for testing.

Ready for external integrations.

5. Orchestration Layer

n8n workflow orchestrates:

Incoming public requests

Calls to the fact-check API

AI explanation generation

Structured response return

6. Web Frontend

Browser-based interface for end users.

Allows claim input and result visualization.

Displays verdict, explanation, and evidence sources.

No technical knowledge required to use.

7. One-Click Deployment

Fully Dockerized system:

Fact-check backend container

Orchestration container

Frontend container

Single Windows batch file to start the entire system.

Automatic model warm-up and readiness checks.

8. Public Accessibility

Secure tunneling exposes the system online.

Remote users can access the application from any device.

No manual IP or network reconfiguration required.

9. Platform Independence

Runs on CPU-only hardware.

No GPU required.

Works on standard laptops.

Ready for cloud deployment.
